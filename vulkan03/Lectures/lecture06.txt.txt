What is a vertex buffer?

* Vertex buffers can store vertex input data and be bound to graphics pipelines.
* 3D models have thousands of vertices.

* The vertex buffer is just a chunk of memory that we can pass into our vertex shader
with whatever data we would like into this memory as long as we tell our graphics
pipeline how it's structured.
